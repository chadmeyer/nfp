This is meant to be a decision making tree to help women/couples
decide what method of Natural Family Planing might be right for them.

This is a tool that others can freely use.  It doesn't _teach_ you 
any methods, it just provides information on different available methods.
If you find one you like you should find a teacher of that method for you!
